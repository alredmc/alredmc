### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alred. I'm a 13 year old developer and content creator! I code in various languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and Batch! I am a professional video editor in Premiere Pro, as well as a decently good thumbnail designer in photoshop. I usually make projects with people like Lava by creating things to do Minecraft related and Discord related.

I've been apart of many projects, such as MrPlex [MrPlex (parent business), MrPlex Network, MrPlex Island, MrPlex Chat], Downside SMP, HyperJet Airlines, PoroProxy, AL Bot, Echo Client, and some other discontinued projects.

If you want to contact me, you can DM me on Discord by messaging Alred#0001, or you can email me using alredinmc@gmail.com.
